# rental-property-management-system
Asia Pacific Home (APH) is a project proposed to help promote the renting property within
Malaysia’s Klang Valley area. As a 4-person developers’ team from APU tech-solution, we
designed this APH system to allow the administrator to manage the information and advertise the
property from an interfacing system called Advert web (mudah). The main features include
searching and renting property, updating property information, managing the admin and manager,
and, last but not least, providing clients with a comprehensive report of the system and property
popularity.
The techniques used in this proposed system include multiple types of data structures, sorting, and
searching algorithms. The data structures used encompasses circular linked list, doubly circular
linked list, queue, stack, and dynamic array. The proposed sorting algorithms are merge and quick
sort, whereas the searching algorithms use binary and linear search. In the sorting and searching
section, we will also compare these algorithms to choose the best algorithm based on their runtime.
The dataset used in this project is called ‘mudah-apartment-kl-selangor.csv.’ It contains detailed
information on the Kuala Lumpur and Selangor area property, which is going to be posted on
mudah. The following are the metadata of the attributes provided in the dataset.
